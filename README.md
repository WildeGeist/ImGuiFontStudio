# ImGuiFontStudio

ImGuiFontStudio is a tool for Subset font and extract glyph names for use embbeded or not in a software, especially for use with ImGui for embedded way.

Greatly inspired / based on the project [IconFontCppHeaders](https://github.com/juliettef/IconFontCppHeaders)

This is my first big opensource software.

As a self learning man i always developped my softs in solo.

So maybe you will found some weird things, bad design pattern, 
bad optimization, or others bullshits :)

Please send me your feedback.
I enjoy all constructive comments and help is welcome.
